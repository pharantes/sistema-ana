## Key Improvements Made

### Cyclomatic Complexity Reduction
- Extracted complex conditional logic into named helper functions
- Split large functions into smaller, focused functions
- Reduced nesting levels through early returns and guard clauses

### Documentation
- Added JSDoc-style comments to public functions
- Explained function purpose, parameters, and return values
- Documented complex business logic

### Variable Naming
- Renamed single-letter and abbreviated variables (q → searchQuery, req → request, res → response)
- Used camelCase consistently
- Made variable names descriptive (e.g., `d` → `parsedDate`, `t` → `currentTime`)

### Code Organization
- Grouped utility functions together
- Placed helper functions before main functions
- Organized imports logically
- Grouped related functionality

### Defect Identification
- No critical defects identified yet
- Some potential issues noted for review (would need // TODO: REVIEW comments)

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. Complete API route handlers refactoring
2. Refactor large component files (modals, tables, forms)
3. Review and refactor validator files
4. Complete acoes detail page refactoring

### Medium Priority
5. Refactor clientes, colaboradores, and contas pages
6. Review and refactor dashboard components
7. Complete remaining helper files

### Low Priority
8. Review model schemas (mostly simple, likely OK)
9. Review auth configuration files
10. Polish and final review

## Notes
- Main focus has been on high-complexity functions in critical paths
- Helper functions have seen the most significant improvements
- API routes partially refactored - good progress on action routes
- Component refactoring will be extensive due to number of files

## Estimated Completion
- Core backend logic (lib/): ~70% complete
- API routes: ~20% complete
- Frontend components: ~5% complete
- Overall progress: ~30% complete

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining API routes
2. Tackle large component files systematically
3. Add defect markers where issues are found
4. Final review pass for consistency
